# Go Expert Study

This repository tracks my progress through the "Go Expert" curriculum, including code, article summaries, and hands-on projects.

## ðŸ“š Modules

1. **Fundamentals & Testing**  
   Deep dive into interfaces, generics, pointers, modules, and all forms of testing (unit, integration, benchmarks, fuzzing).

2. **API & Databases**  
   Build REST APIs with authentication, integrate PostgreSQL, learn migrations, validations, and security best practices.

3. **Concurrency & Performance**  
   Master goroutines, channels, contexts, worker pools, the Go scheduler, memory profiling, and performance tuning.

4. **Clean Architecture & DDD**  
   Learn to structure real-world applications with Clean Architecture, DDD principles, and RabbitMQ-based messaging.

5. **(Coming Soon)** Advanced distributed systems and Go internals.

## ðŸ§  Study Approach

Each topic includes:
- âœ… Practical code examples
- ðŸ“„ Article notes
- ðŸ“‚ Mini projects or exercises
- ðŸ§¾ Topic summary (`README.md` per folder)

## ðŸš€ Goal

By the end of this study, I aim to:
- Build production-ready APIs in Go
- Apply Clean Architecture and testing strategies
- Build concurrent, performant, testable, and scalable applications
