# Module 01 – Fundamentals and Testing

This module covers the core language features and testing strategies in Go.

## Weekly Topics

1. **Interfaces, Generics & Pointers**  
   Understand type systems, interface polymorphism, and pointer mechanics.

2. **Go Modules & Workspaces**  
   Learn dependency management, semantic versioning, and multi-module development.

3. **Testing – Part 1: Unit & Integration**  
   Table-driven tests, testify, mocking external APIs.

4. **Testing – Part 2: Benchmark, Fuzzing & E2E**  
   Performance tests, fuzz inputs, and end-to-end tests using `httptest`.

## Final Project  
A small CLI application developed with TDD (Test-Driven Development), demonstrating interfaces, generics, and testing best practices.
